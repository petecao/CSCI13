Programming Concept/Methods II: Advanced Java (Review of OOP, Gradles, JUnit, Data Structures, GUIs, APIs, multithreading, REST)

## About
These are my programs and notes for CSCI 13 for the Fall 2019 semester at Sierra College! Feel free to look at these resources!

## Course Catalog Description
Application of software engineering techniques to the design and development of large programs; data abstraction and structures and associated algorithms

### Course Catalog Learning Objectives
* Implement linear lists with arrays and linked objects.
* Write programs that use the stack and queue data structures, based on provided specifications.
* Produce intermediate-sized programs using Object-Oriented design principles, with a combination of written and provided code.
* Identify effective techniques to test, debug, and document larger programs.
* Write a program that uses recursive algorithms operating on a binary tree.

## Class Syllabus Description
This is the second Java programming course at Sierra College. In this course we will continue with what you learned in CSCI 12 and expand upon that knowledge. We will cover advanced Java and object oriented topics and learning how the various components fit together.

### Class Learning Objectives

* Basic data structures including arrays, linked lists, stacks, and hash maps.
* Unify similar data structures with interfaces.
* Use the data structures to implement large GUI applications.
* Develop applications that utilize web-based resources.

## Class Schedule
* Week 1 and Lab 1: Introduction to IntelliJ and an Industry-Grade IDE
* Lab 2:
